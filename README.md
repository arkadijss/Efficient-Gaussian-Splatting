# 3D Gaussian Splatting and Compression for Efficient and Accelerated Novel View Synthesis

This repository contains the implementation of the project "3D Gaussian Splatting and Compression for
Efficient and Accelerated Novel View Synthesis" for the course "Hands-on AI based 3D Vision" (summer semester 2025) at the University of Tübingen.

The project authors are Arkādijs Sergejevs and Leon Lemke.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the great works [3D Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting), [Mini-Splatting](https://github.com/fatPeter/mini-splatting).
